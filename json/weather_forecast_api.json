Time always starts at\n0:00 today and contains 168 hours. If\n&forecast\\_days=16 is set, up to 16 days of forecast can be returned. All URL parameters\nare listed below:\n\n| Parameter | Format | Required | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| latitude, longitude | Floating point | Yes |  | Geographical WGS84 coordinates of the location. Multiple coordinates can be comma separated. E.g. &latitude=52.52,48.85&longitude=13.41,2.35. To return data for multiple locations the JSON output changes to a list of structures. CSV and XLSX formats add a column location\\_id. |\n| elevation | Floating point | No |  | The elevation used for statistical downscaling. Per default, a [90 meter digital elevation model is used](https://openmeteo.substack.com/p/improving-weather-forecasts-with \"Elevation based grid-cell selection explained\"). You can manually set the elevation to correctly match mountain peaks. If &elevation=nan is specified, downscaling will be disabled and the API uses the average grid-cell height. For multiple locations, elevation can also be comma separated. |\n| hourly | String array | No |  | A list of weather variables which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &hourly= parameter in the URL can be used. |\n| daily | String array | No |  | A list of daily weather variable aggregations which should be returned. Values can be comma separated, or multiple &daily= parameter in the URL can be used. If daily weather variables are specified, parameter timezone is required. |\n| current | String array | No |  | A list of weather variables to get current conditions. |\n| temperature\\_unit | String | No | celsius | If fahrenheit is set, all temperature values are converted to Fahrenheit. |\n| wind\\_speed\\_unit | String | No | kmh | Other wind speed speed units: ms, mph and kn |\n| precipitation\\_unit | String | No | mm | Other precipitation amount units: inch |\n| timeformat | String | No | iso8601 | If format unixtime is selected, all time values are returned in UNIX epoch time in seconds. Please note that all timestamp are in GMT+0! For daily values with unix timestamps, please apply utc\\_offset\\_seconds again to get the correct date. |\n| timezone | String | No | GMT | If timezone is set, all timestamps are returned as local-time and data is returned starting at 00:00 local-time. Any time zone name from the [time zone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) is supported. If auto is set as a time zone, the coordinates will be automatically resolved to the local time zone. For multiple coordinates, a comma separated list of timezones can be specified. |\n| past\\_days | Integer (0-92) | No | 0 | If past\\_days is set, yesterday or the day before yesterday data are also returned. |\n| forecast\\_days | Integer (0-16) | No | 7 | Per default, only 7 days are returned. Up to 16 days of forecast are possible. |\n| forecast\\_hoursforecast\\_minutely\\_15past\\_hourspast\\_minutely\\_15 | Integer (>0) | No |  | Similar to forecast\\_days, the number of timesteps of hourly and 15-minutely data can controlled. Instead of using the current day as a reference, the current hour or the current 15-minute time-step is used. |\n| start\\_dateend\\_date | String (yyyy-mm-dd) | No |  | The time interval to get weather data. A day must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g. 2022-06-30). |\n| start\\_hourend\\_hourstart\\_minutely\\_15end\\_minutely\\_15 | String (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm) | No |  | The time interval to get weather data for hourly or 15 minutely data. Time must be specified as an ISO8601 date (e.g. 2022-06-30T12:00). |\n| models | String array | No | auto | Manually select one or more weather models. Per default, the best suitable weather models will be combined. |\n| cell\\_selection | String | No | land | Set a preference how grid-cells are selected. The default land finds a suitable grid-cell on land with [similar elevation to the requested coordinates using a 90-meter digital elevation model](https://openmeteo.substack.com/p/improving-weather-forecasts-with \"Elevation based grid-cell selection explained\"). sea prefers grid-cells on sea. nearest selects the nearest possible grid-cell. |\n| apikey | String | No |  | Only required to commercial use to access reserved API resources for customers. The server URL requires the prefix customer-. See [pricing](/en/pricing \"Pricing information to use the weather API commercially\") for more information. |\n\nAdditional optional URL parameters will be added.
