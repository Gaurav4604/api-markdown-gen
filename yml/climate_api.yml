        - value: temperature_2m_max, temperature_2m_min, temperature_2m_mean
          unit: °C (°F)
          description:
            Maximum, minimum and mean daily air temperature at 2 meters above
            ground. Additionally, temperature is downscaled using a 90-meter digital
            elevation model. Climate models are not perfect, and they have inherent
            uncertainties and biases that can affect the accuracy of their temperature
            predictions. However, the temperature anomaly over a long period of time
            is a good indicator the future Earth's climate. The following paper analyses
            the robustness of CMIP6 temperature predictions.
        - value: cloud_cover_mean
          unit: "%"
          description:
            Mean cloud cover on a given day. Cloud cover in climate models
            is generally represented through simplified parameterizations that estimate
            the cloud amount, height, and thickness based on atmospheric conditions
            such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. These parameterizations have
            been shown to provide reasonable estimates of global cloud cover but they
            can have significant uncertainties and biases on regional and local scales.
            Systematic biases have been corrected using the weather reanalysis ERA5.
        - value: relative_humidity_2m_max, relative_humidity_2m_min, relative_humidity_2m_mean
          unit: "%"
          description:
            Maximum, minimum and mean daily relative humidity at 2 meters
            above ground. While systematic biases in relative humidity have been removed
            through bias correction, caution should still be exercised when using relative
            humidity data as raw data shows larger differences between different climate
            models.
        - value: soil_moisture_0_to_10cm_mean
          unit: m³/m³
          description:
            Daily mean soil moisture fraction within 0-10 cm. Soil moisture
            data is only available by MRI_AGCM3_2_S and EC_Earth3P_HR. Due to the limited
            number of climate models that provide soil moisture data, it is not possible
            to make a general statement about their accuracy. As a result, it may be
            advisable to conduct your own water balance modeling.
        - value: precipitation_sum
          unit: mm
          description:
            Sum of daily precipitation (including rain, showers and snowfall).
            Climate models have been able to capture some of the large-scale patterns
            of precipitation and associated droughts and extreme precipitation events,
            particularly over longer time scales. However, there are still uncertainties
            associated with the representation of precipitation at smaller geographical
            scales including thunderstorm. Please compare different climate models for
            drought duration or extreme precipitation events. The following papers analyze
            extreme precipitation and droughts in CMIP6 models.
        - value: rain_sum
          unit: mm
          description: Sum of daily liquid rain, excluding snow.
        - value: snowfall_sum
          unit: cm
          description:
            Sum of daily snowfall. Please note that snowfall data may have
            larger biases in complex terrain, as it is not adjusted for different terrain
            elevations. Use this data with caution to estimate how mountainous regions
            will be effected by reduced snowfall.
        - value: wind_speed_10m_mean, wind_speed_10m_max
          unit: km/h (mph, m/s, knots)
          description:
            Mean and maximum wind speed 10 meter above ground on a day. Simulations
            of winds and pressure systems in climate models are greatly influenced by
            the resolution used to model the terrain. Without bias correction, wind
            speed can vary significantly between different climate models, particularly
            in complex terrain. Although, data is bias corrected with ERA5, it might
            not accurately represent local conditions.
        - value: pressure_msl_mean
          unit: hPa
          description: Daily mean air pressure reduced to mean sea level.
        - value: shortwave_radiation_sum
          unit: MJ/m²
          description:
            The sum of solar radiation on a given day in Megajoules. Shortwave
            radiation predictions are impacted by aerosols and clouds present in the
            atmosphere. The future composition of gases in the atmosphere is a key area
            of study in climate modeling. As there are uncertainties associated with
            aerosols and clouds, it is important to take these into account when using
            shortwave radiation data.
