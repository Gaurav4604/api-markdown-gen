        enum:
          - value: temperature_2m_max, temperature_2m_min, temperature_2m_mean
            unit: °C (°F)
            description:
              Maximum, minimum and mean daily air temperature at 2 meters above
              ground. Additionally, temperature is downscaled using a 90-meter digital
              elevation model. Climate models are not perfect, and they have inherent
              uncertainties and biases that can affect the accuracy of their temperature
              predictions. However, the temperature anomaly over a long period of time
              is a good indicator the future Earth's climate. The following paper analyses
              the robustness of CMIP6 temperature predictions.
          - value: cloud_cover_mean
            unit: "%"
            description:
              Mean cloud cover on a given day. Cloud cover in climate models
              is generally represented through simplified parameterizations that estimate
              the cloud amount, height, and thickness based on atmospheric conditions
              such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. These parameterizations have
              been shown to provide reasonable estimates of global cloud cover but they
              can have significant uncertainties and biases on regional and local scales.
              Systematic biases have been corrected using the weather reanalysis ERA5.
          - value: relative_humidity_2m_max, relative_humidity_2m_min, relative_humidity_2m_mean
            unit: "%"
            description:
              Maximum, minimum and mean daily relative humidity at 2 meters
              above ground. While systematic biases in relative humidity have been removed
              through bias correction, caution should still be exercised when using relative
              humidity data as raw data shows larger differences between different climate
              models.
          - value: soil_moisture_0_to_10cm_mean
            unit: m³/m³
            description:
              Daily mean soil moisture fraction within 0-10 cm. Soil moisture
              data is only available by MRI_AGCM3_2_S and EC_Earth3P_HR. Due to the limited
              number of climate models that provide soil moisture data, it is not possible
              to make a general statement about their accuracy. As a result, it may be
              advisable to conduct your own water balance modeling.
          - value: precipitation_sum
            unit: mm
            description:
              Sum of daily precipitation (including rain, showers and snowfall).
              Climate models have been able to capture some of the large-scale patterns
              of precipitation and associated droughts and extreme precipitation events,
              particularly over longer time scales. However, there are still uncertainties
              associated with the representation of precipitation at smaller geographical
              scales including thunderstorm. Please compare different climate models for
              drought duration or extreme precipitation events. The following papers analyze
              extreme precipitation and droughts in CMIP6 models.
          - value: rain_sum
            unit: mm
            description: Sum of daily liquid rain, excluding snow.
          - value: snowfall_sum
            unit: cm
            description:
              Sum of daily snowfall. Please note that snowfall data may have
              larger biases in complex terrain, as it is not adjusted for different terrain
              elevations. Use this data with caution to estimate how mountainous regions
              will be effected by reduced snowfall.
          - value: wind_speed_10m_mean, wind_speed_10m_max
            unit: km/h (mph, m/s, knots)
            description:
              Mean and maximum wind speed 10 meter above ground on a day. Simulations
              of winds and pressure systems in climate models are greatly influenced by
              the resolution used to model the terrain. Without bias correction, wind
              speed can vary significantly between different climate models, particularly
              in complex terrain. Although, data is bias corrected with ERA5, it might
              not accurately represent local conditions.
          - value: pressure_msl_mean
            unit: hPa
            description: Daily mean air pressure reduced to mean sea level.
          - value: shortwave_radiation_sum
            unit: MJ/m²
            description:
              The sum of solar radiation on a given day in Megajoules. Shortwave
              radiation predictions are impacted by aerosols and clouds present in the
              atmosphere. The future composition of gases in the atmosphere is a key area
              of study in climate modeling. As there are uncertainties associated with
              aerosols and clouds, it is important to take these into account when using
              shortwave radiation data.

    description:
      Setting disable_bias_correction to true disables statistical downscaling
      and bias correction onto ERA5-Land. By default, all data is corrected using linear
      bias correction, and coefficients have been calculated for each month over a 50-year
      time series. The climate change signal is not affected by linear bias correction.
