[Weather Forecast API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs), which utilizes multiple local weather models for forecasts extending up to 16 days.

## API Response

[Python API client](https://pypi.org/project/openmeteo-requests/) documentation.

#### Install

```
pip install openmeteo-requests
pip install requests-cache retry-requests numpy pandas
```


#### Usage

```
import openmeteo_requests
import requests_cache
import pandas as pd
from retry_requests import retry
# Setup the Open-Meteo API client with cache and retry on error
cache_session = requests_cache.CachedSession('.cache', expire_after = 3600)
retry_session = retry(cache_session, retries = 5, backoff_factor = 0.2)
openmeteo = openmeteo_requests.Client(session = retry_session)
# Make sure all required weather variables are listed here
# The order of variables in hourly or daily is important to assign them correctly below
url = "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast"
params = {
"latitude": 52.52,
"longitude": 13.41,
"hourly": "temperature_2m",
"models": "bom_access_global"
}
responses = openmeteo.weather_api(url, params=params)
# Process first location. Add a for-loop for multiple locations or weather models
response = responses[0]
print(f"Coordinates {response.Latitude()}°N {response.Longitude()}°E")
print(f"Elevation {response.Elevation()} m asl")
print(f"Timezone {response.Timezone()} {response.TimezoneAbbreviation()}")
print(f"Timezone difference to GMT+0 {response.UtcOffsetSeconds()} s")
# Process hourly data. The order of variables needs to be the same as requested.
hourly = response.Hourly()
hourly_temperature_2m = hourly.Variables(0).ValuesAsNumpy()
hourly_data = {"date": pd.date_range(
start = pd.to_datetime(hourly.Time(), unit = "s", utc = True),
end = pd.to_datetime(hourly.TimeEnd(), unit = "s", utc = True),
freq = pd.Timedelta(seconds = hourly.Interval()),
inclusive = "left"
)}
hourly_data["temperature_2m"] = hourly_temperature_2m
hourly_dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data = hourly_data)
print(hourly_dataframe)
```


## Data Source

The API relies on weather forecasts generated by the ACCESS-G model from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM). It presents data in 1-hour intervals, delivering forecasts for a duration of up to 10 days. The model undergoes four daily runs at 0:00, 6:00, 12:00, and 18:00 UTC.

| Weather Model | Region | Spatial Resolution | Temporal Resolution | Forecast Length | Update frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## API Documentation

The API endpoint /v1/bom accepts a geographical coordinate, a list of weather variables and responds with a JSON hourly weather forecast for 7 days. Time always starts at 0:00 today and contains 168 hours. If &forecast_days=16 is set, up to 10 days of forecast can be returned. All URL parameters are listed below:

| Parameter | Format | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| latitude, longitude | Floating point | Yes | ||
| elevation | Floating point | No | The elevation used for statistical downscaling. Per default, a

[time zone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)is supported. If auto is set as a time zone, the coordinates will be automatically resolved to the local time zone. For multiple coordinates, a comma separated list of timezones can be specified.past_hours

| Variable | Valid time | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| temperature_2m | Instant | °C (°F) | Air temperature at 2 meters above ground |
| relative_humidity_2m | Instant | % | Relative humidity at 2 meters above ground |
| dew_point_2m | Instant | °C (°F) | Dew point temperature at 2 meters above ground |
| apparent_temperature | Instant | °C (°F) | |
| pressure_msl surface_pressure | Instant | hPa | |
| cloud_cover | Instant | % | Total cloud cover as an area fraction |
| cloud_cover_low | Instant | % | Low level clouds and fog up to 3 km altitude |
| cloud_cover_mid | Instant | % | Mid level clouds from 3 to 8 km altitude |
| cloud_cover_high | Instant | % | High level clouds from 8 km altitude |
| wind_speed_10m wind_speed_40m wind_speed_80m wind_speed_120m | Instant | km/h (mph, m/s, knots) | Wind speed at 10, 40, 80 or 120 meters above ground. Wind speed on 10 meters is the standard level. |
| wind_direction_10m wind_direction_40m wind_direction_80m wind_direction_120m | Instant | ° | Wind direction at 10, 40, 80 or 120 meters above ground |
| wind_gusts_10m | Preceding hour max | km/h (mph, m/s, knots) | Gusts at 10 meters above ground as a maximum of the preceding hour |
| shortwave_radiation | Preceding hour mean | W/m² | |
| direct_radiation direct_normal_irradiance | Preceding hour mean | W/m² | Direct solar radiation as average of the preceding hour on the horizontal plane and the normal plane (perpendicular to the sun). |
| diffuse_radiation | Preceding hour mean | W/m² | Diffuse solar radiation as average of the preceding hour. |
| global_tilted_irradiance | Preceding hour mean | W/m² | Total radiation received on a tilted pane as average of the preceding hour. The calculation is assuming a fixed albedo of 20% and in isotropic sky. Please specify tilt and azimuth parameter. Tilt ranges from 0° to 90° and is typically around 45°. Azimuth should be close to 0° (0° south, -90° east, 90° west). If azimuth is set to "nan", the calculation assumes a horizontal tracker. If tilt is set to "nan", it is assumed that the panel has a vertical tracker. If both are set to "nan", a bi-axial tracker is assumed. |
| sunshine_duration | Preceding hour sum | Seconds | Number of seconds of sunshine of the preceding hour per hour calculated by direct normalized irradiance exceeding 120 W/m², following the WMO definition. |
| vapour_pressure_deficit | Instant | kPa | Vapor Pressure Deificit (VPD) in kilopascal (kPa). For high VPD (>1.6), water transpiration of plants increases. For low VPD (<0.4), transpiration decreases |
| et0_fao_evapotranspiration | Preceding hour sum | mm (inch) | ET₀ Reference Evapotranspiration of a well watered grass field. Based on
